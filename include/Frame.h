/**
* Represents a frame, an image, with the detected keypoints.
*
* Frame represents a camera pose, with its image, detected 2D points, its descriptors, its 3D mapping, pose and others.
*
* The frame's position on the map is obtained with Frame::GetCameraCenter. The orientation is obtained with Frame::GetRotationInverse.
*
* Tracking uses 3 frames:
* - Frame::mCurrentFrame
* - Frame::mInitialFrame
* - Frame::mLastFrame
*
* Each frame has its own K calibration matrix
* It is usually the same matrix (with the same values) for every frame and keyframes.
*
* The constructor clones Mat K, making a copy in Frame::mK.
* Then, it analyzes but does not save the image. It is lost when the constructor ends its execution.
* Part of the analysis consists in detecting keypoints, extracting its descriptors and classifying them.
*
* Keypoints, descriptors, BoW and tracked 3D points are registered in parallel vectors and explained in Frame::N.
*
* The coordinate system and the meaning of the position matrices is explained in Frame::mTcw.
*
* This class does not determine the frame's pose. Its pose is registered by Tracking and Optimizer.
*
* The matrix's pose is explained in Frame::mTcw.
